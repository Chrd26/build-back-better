### 3. Zen

### 4. Proxmity Effect

 Make all of your game music using only objects that are in close environment (for example, tapping pen on table to create a beat, etc).
 
 ### 5. The Number 23 
 
 It’s 2023. The number 23 represents change, progress, innovation, new beginnings, revolution, and transformation. Integrate one or more of these themes into your game.
